--- String Datatype
-- Data type	    Description
-- CHAR(size)	    A fixed length string which can have letters, numbers, and special characters. The size parameter specifies the column length in characters which can vary from from 0 to 255. Default size is 1
-- VARCHAR(size)	A variable length string which can contain letters, numbers, and special characters. The size parameter specifies the maximum string length in characters which can vary from 0 to 65535.
-- BINARY(size)	    This is equal to CHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the column length in bytes. Default size is 1
-- VARBINARY(size)	This is equal to VARCHAR(), but stores binary byte strings. The size parameter specifies the maximum column length in bytes.
-- TINYTEXT	        This holds a string with a maximum length of 255 characters
-- TEXT(size)	    This holds a string with a maximum length of 65,535 bytes
-- LONGTEXT	        This holds a string with a maximum length of 4,294,967,295 characters
-- TINYBLOB	        This represents a small BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Max length is 255 bytes
-- BLOB(size)	    This represents a BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 65,535 bytes of data
-- MEDIUMTEXT	    This holds a string with a maximum length of 16,777,215 characters
-- MEDIUMBLOB	    This represents a medium BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 16,777,215 bytes of data
-- LONGBLOB	        This represents a large BLOBs (Binary Large Objects). Holds up to 4,294,967,295 bytes of data
-- ENUM(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can contain only one value, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 65535 values in an ENUM list. If a value is inserted that is not in the list, a blank value will be inserted. The values are sorted in the order you enter them
-- SET(val1, val2, val3, ...)	A string object that can have 0 or more values, chosen from a list of possible values. You can list up to 64 values in a SET list
