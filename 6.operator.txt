SQL Arithmetic Operators

+	Addition	10 + 20 = 30
-	Subtraction	20 - 30 = -10
*	Multiplication	10 * 20 = 200
/	Division	20 / 10 = 2
%	Modulus	5 % 2 = 1

SQL Comparison Operators

=	Equal to	5 = 5 returns TRUE
!=	Not equal	5 != 6 returns TRUE
<>	Not equal	5 <> 4 returns TRUE
>	Greater than	4 > 5 returns FALSE
<	Less than	4 < 5 returns TRUE
>=	Greater than or equal to	4 >= 5 returns FALSE
<=	Less than or equal to	4 <= 5 returns TRUE
!<	Not less than	4 !< 5 returns FALSE
!>	Not greater than	4 !> 5 returns TRUE

SQL Logical Operators

ALL	TRUE if all of a set of comparisons are TRUE.	
AND	TRUE if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.	
ANY	TRUE if any one of a set of comparisons are TRUE.	
BETWEEN	TRUE if the operand lies within the range of comparisons.	
EXISTS	TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records	
IN	TRUE if the operand is equal to one of a list of expressions.	
LIKE	TRUE if the operand matches a pattern specially with wildcard.	
NOT	Reverses the value of any other Boolean operator.	
OR	TRUE if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE	
IS NULL	TRUE if the expression value is NULL.	
SOME	TRUE if some of a set of comparisons are TRUE.	
UNIQUE	The UNIQUE operator searches every row of a specified table for uniqueness (no duplicates).
